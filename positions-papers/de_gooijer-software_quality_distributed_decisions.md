## Why Software Architecture?
### Indispensable to progress and productivity
Software is easy to copy and reuse. Every developer reuses code in the form of libraries whether open source, commercial SDK or earlier internal work. More and more software services are commodities sold as subscriptions: cloud services. Yet, we spend a lot of time writing programs for unique problems. Planning software development through software architecture means teams can make progress on complex system development despite dependencies on cloud services, code libraries, and other teams.

### Important for sustainable systems
As long as the organization lives, software evolves. Software development is never "done". Not only because needs change but also because the understanding of the needs improves with time. Unfortunately, it is difficult to change the domain and data models that describe these needs once embodied in the software. It is through both up-front and continuous work with the software architecture that we can create systems that can adapt to change.

Many systems live increasingly long lives, which means that technology advances quicker than software systems retire. Software architects guide their teams and organizations in decisions that help adapt new technology. Architects steer clear of the latest hype and limit unnecessary creativity among developers but enable the system to embrace shifts that benefit the users. 

### Unique communication challenge
The job of a software architect is as much a social role as a technical one. Grounded in the reality of code on one end and in the abstract ideas of future endeavors on the other. The work requires the ability to think systematically using abstractions and communicate these through models. Reasoning about impact of technology choices, future business ideas, and facts created by decisions from the past. The architect uses a mathematical mind to reason about the impact of the CAP theorem, time, and cryptography; and a social skill to communicate with the stakeholders in the system.

##  Teams Own Architectures, Architects Coach Teams
The philosophy of my own architecture practice is that everybody on the team contributes to the architecture. Everybody is an architect: developers, requirements engineers, UX designers, product owners. The architect's job is to bring all these different disciplines together to create and implement a sustainable architecture. The architect coaches the team to work within the constraints of the chosen technologies to deliver the quality properties that stakeholders need. Therefore, I believe in providing guiding principles for distributed decision making, rather than writing proverbial clay tablets to pass from the mountain top with decrees on how things shall be. The challenge is of course to equip others with the core knowledge to make the right design decisions.
