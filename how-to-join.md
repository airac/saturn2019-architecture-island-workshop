# How to Join

Interested in exploring the essence of software design?  Here is how you can
become a participant in the workshop:

1. Contact one of the workshop organizers.  They’ll let you know whether
   there are still available spots in the workshop.
2. Prepare a brief "position paper" containing your ideas, questions, and
   experiences and submit it to the workshop by [forking this workshop repository
   in GitHub and issing a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
   with your position paper included.
3. Register for the SATURN 2019 conference.

**You must have RSVP'd to the workshop by April 22, 2019 to participate.
Position papers are due by April 29, 2019.**

## Position Papers

What should be included in your position paper?  A variety of possible ideas
could be appropriate.  [See the list of thinking questions to help get you
started](questions.md). The main point of a position paper is to create a
starting off point for planning workshop activities.  You can look at position
papers from past workshops to get an idea, or create something new.

Some ideas for what to put in a position paper:

* Explain a **personal experience** (positive and/or negative) with software
  architecture or design.  What topics have proved most influential throughout
  your career?  Take a stab at creating your own "Best of" list.
* Describe some **specific problems** that you've encountered in design and reflect
  on how they are related (or different).
* Describe some of your own **philosophy** regarding software arhictecture design.
* **Ask some questions** -- What are you most curious or concerned or excited or confused
  or ... about the essence of software architecture?  Oftentimes a good question is more
  valuable than 100 answers.

All workshop material will be published to the GitHub repository including write-ups,
images, and position papers.  Having run a few workshops now, we’ve found that using GitHub
as the publicly available resource and mechanism for organization is rather tidy and useful.
